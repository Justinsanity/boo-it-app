### What's different?
This project is the client side app made for "Boo it" with PhoneGap framework. Note that this repo does not contain any packaged platform project.

### How to build for platform?
Referencing to PhoneGap tutorial, you could use `cordova platform add android` to add Android version package, `cordova platform add ios` for iOS,  `cordova platform add firefoxos` for Firefox OS (Not yet testing, you could also reference to [this article](http://blog.mozilla.com.tw/posts/6324/phonegap-developer-app-preview-for-firefox-os?utm_source=epaper&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=epaper140930&utm_content=mozilla) written by Mozilla engineer) ... and so on.
